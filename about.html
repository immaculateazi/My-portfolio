    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Immaculate Onyebuchi Azi, a dedicated Junior Front-End Developer from Nigeria with a strong passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-focused websites.
 My interest in technology began with a curiosity about how websites work, and it grew into a commitment to building modern, accessible digital experiences. 
 With a degree in Computer Science from IMT Enugu, I have developed solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress, along with hands-on experience using modern tools and workflows.</p>
<p>I specialize in designing intuitive interfaces, improving site performance, and building mobile-friendly layouts that enhance user experience. 
 My background as a Virtual Assistant has strengthened my attention to detail, communication, and problem-solving skills, all essential qualities in front-end development. 
 I stay committed to continuous learning, exploring new frameworks, and keeping up with emerging trends to deliver creative and effective web solutions.
  I enjoy transforming ideas into functional designs and making websites that are fast, visually appealing, and optimized for SEO.</p>
<p> As I grow in my career, my goal is to transition into full-stack development and contribute to innovative, impactful projects. I'm excited about taking on new challenges,
 collaborating with great teams, and building digital solutions that inspire users and add meaningful value to the tech industry.</p>
